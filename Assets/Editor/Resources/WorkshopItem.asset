  Title: Connection Check Module
  Description: "[h1] Connection Check Module [/h1]\r\n\r\n[b] 500 subscribers! [/b]\r\nMain
    mechanic of the module is checking the existance of line connections from a chart
    and using that data to disarm the module. But you'll have to check the bombs serial
    number before that. You should better read the manual to understand what I mean.\r\n\r\nLatest
    Changes:\r\n- Click sounds added.\r\n- Now using the default module base.\r\n\r\n-
    Joystick now works?\r\n\r\nModule comes with a short mission pack to get you started
    with Connection Checking. Have fun!\r\n\r\nManual is included but you can grab
    it from there as well ==> http://ktane.timwi.de/PDF/Connection%20Check.pdf\n\nModule
    type is \"[b]graphModule[/b]\". I will be happy if want to use this module in
    your mod/mission pack.\r\n\r\nAny comments and suggestions will be appreciated!\r\n\r\n[h1]
    Announcement! [/h1]\r\n\r\nMy new module set! Give it a try! Cute lil creatures.
