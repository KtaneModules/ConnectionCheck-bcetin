  Title: Connection Check Module
  Description: "[h1] Connection Check Module [/h1]\r\n\r\n[b] 400 subscribers? BOOYEAH!
    Thanks for the support everyone! [/b]\r\n\r\nMain mechanic of the module is checking
    the existance of line connections from a chart and using that data to disarm the
    module. But you'll have to check the bombs serial number before that. You should
    better read the manual to understand what I mean.\r\n\r\nLatest Changes:\r\n-
    Click sounds added.\r\n- Now using the default module base.\r\n\r- Joystick now
    works?\n\nModule comes with a short mission pack to get you started with Connection
    Checking. Have fun!\r\n\r\nManual: https://www.dropbox.com/s/p4l1lu3hf4l9vvh/ConnectionCheckManual.pdf
    (It is included in the files but you can also download from here. Credit for the
    manual page goes to \"Fred Erik\")\r\n\r\nThings I plan to add/change:\r\n\r\n-
    Visuals (I plan adding levers as control, not buttons. There will be a led indicator,
    still)\r\n\r\nModule type is \"[b]graphModule[/b]\". I will be happy if want to
    use this module in your mod/mission pack.\r\n\r\nAny comments and suggestions
    will be appreciated!"
